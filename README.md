# WinFlipped
WinFlipped is an attempt to mimic the functionality of Flip3D (available on Windows Vista/7) on Windows 10/11.

It works by screen grabbing all available windows. For security and privacy reasons, screenshots are not saved anywhere. 

This is not a perfect Flip3D replacement, but as far as I know, there is no better way, since Windows does not provide a good API for this.

This is a WPF program, running on .NET 8.0.

This project is currently a WIP.
# Usage
